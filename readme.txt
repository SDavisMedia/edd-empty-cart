Easily add content to the empty cart display in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

Built for use with the Easy Digital Downloads plugin, this extension provides settings for the display of the [download_checkout] shortcode when no items are in the cart.

Follow EDD Empty Cartâ€™s development on [Github](https://github.com/sdavismedia/edd-empty-cart).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) installed.
2. Upload `edd-empty-cart` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Navigate to Downloads -> Settings -> Extensions (tab) -> Empty Cart (section) in your WordPress dashboard.
5. Adjust your settings and save. You can see the output by viewing your EDD checkout page when there are no items in the cart.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
